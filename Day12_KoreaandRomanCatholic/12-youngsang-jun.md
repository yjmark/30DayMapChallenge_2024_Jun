In the 17th century, Catholicism was introduced to Korea by envoys traveling to and from Beijing, China. Initially, it was regarded as a new field of study rather than a religion and was referred to as \"Western Learning (Seohak)\". It is unprecedented worldwide that Catholic faith was grown by Koreans themselves before the arrival of Western missionaries.
